### Getting started with development
- Download Node.js
- Clone this repository
- Run `npm install` in a terminal inside the folder of the repository
- Run `npm run dev` for a development runtime with hot reloading or `npm run build` to build a static version of the site in the `./out/` subfolder
- **before you start committing stuff, run `git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig`** (for details, read the `.gitconfig` file)

### Used technology
- React (JavaScript UI library)
- Next.js (framework for React)
- Bulma (CSS component library)
- bulmaswatch/cyborg (a dark theme for Bulma*)
- TypeScript (JavaScript with more features like data types)
- Netlify (static website host)

Some of these are connected through specific packages, like `react-bulma-components`, which gives us React components for getting the HTML that we'd otherwise have to make using tons of classes with Bulma.

**Next.js is basically our "backend". It manages the logical (not visual) structure of the site, where which files go, how pages link to each other fluently and it also turns our site into static HTML, CSS and JavaScript that we can host with Netlify.**

All JavaScript/HTML is written in either plain TypeScript, or TSX, which is TypeScript + JSX. JSX is syntax that React uses.
Most files, like components or pages, will be *.tsx files, combining JSX (React) and TypeScript.

**cyborg is the base theme, but we heavily overwrite CSS rules for our own P+ style*
